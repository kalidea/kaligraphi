# Purpose

`<kal-slider>` allows for the selection of a value from a range via mouse or keyboard.


# Gesture Support
kal-slider relies on HammerJS for gestures. 
In order to get the full feature-set of these components, HammerJS must be loaded into the application.

You can add HammerJS to your application via npm, a CDN (such as the Google CDN), or served directly from your app.

```
npm install --save hammerjs
```

After installing, import it on your app's entry point (e.g. src/main.ts).

```
import 'hammerjs';
```
